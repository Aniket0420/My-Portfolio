              Hey there, I am Aniket Singh Rathore, Computer Science engineer student. When I'm free, I usually build new projects and learn new technologies. The one thing I canâ€™t leave home without is my laptop. Because I like to learn new technology whenever I get time. <br />
                <br />
                I believe my strength is my attitude, and I like to take up challenges and think to accept both success and failure in a balanced way to move forward. I want to say that I don't leave any questions altogether as I believe in myself and my work.<br />
                <br />
                My short-term goal is to achieve excellence in the skills I'm mastering, take up a challenge in some good organizations, and climb the ladder of success. However, my long-term goal is to be a renowned Software Development engineer in an organization and reach the highest level of success. My moral is never to intend to harm anyone on purpose.
